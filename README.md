<a href="http://helpnepal.net">Help Nepal Network (HeNN)</a>  has launched E-Library campaign <a href="http://helpnepal.net/story/one-district-one-e-library-campaign"> “One E-Library Per District” </a>. HeNN has been establishing E-Libraries in several districts of Nepal since a decade. We volunteers of Kathmandu University Open Source Community visit several districts to do the deployment of new elibrary setup and monitor them as well. But we are still unable to view the impact made by our contribution. Like in numbers we’ve established almost 35+ E-Libraries but the impact is still unsatisfactory.

Therefore all the information like school that has established the E-Library , students that are using the E-Library, contents they are using, etc. should be collected to understand the status of E-Libraries. According to those data we can make further analysis and can take steps to improve them.

The fact sheets prepared below are the contribution of Volunteers from Kathmandu University Open Source Community who are also the technical backbone for Help Nepal Network in the establishment and promotion of HeNN E-Library Project.
These factsheets will be mgrated  chronologically to our github repository https://github.com/henn-elibrary-project 
Also with the help of this fact sheets volunteers can create infographs in coming days.
